Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shubham Bajaj, and I'm currently working at `Airtel`, India's leading telecom company, as a software engineer in the postpaid business line since January 2023. Before that, I spent six months as a software engineer at `Refyne`, India's first EarlySalary startup, from August 2022 to December 2022. My journey into software engineering began in 2022 when I joined the software boot camp called `neogcamp` after graduating in 2020.

At Airtel, my main focus is on building web apps for B2B teams, particularly within the `Interaction Platform`, which serves as a centralized dashboard for managing various services used by different teams. Currently, I'm immersed in the `Case Management Platform` project, where I'm tasked with creating and managing milestones and templates for end-user tickets. This initiative aims to streamline processes, eliminate redundancy, clarify ambiguities, and uphold standards in ticket management.

Recently, I've also joined the open-source organization [Trusthauthx](https://github.com/One-Click-Auth), a platform that offers low-code authentication solutions based on zero-trust protocols, boasting 50 active paid users. My contributions here involve implementing passkeys as widgets and developing the [Trusthauthx starter template using React.js](https://github.com/One-Click-Auth/TS-TrustauthX-Templates/tree/main/Templates/example-reactjs-starter), as well as configuring TypeScript builds to cater to both modern and legacy browsers.

- I tackle problems first on paper before translating them into code.
- When it comes to frontend development, I prioritize understanding data, and I firmly believe in separating business logic from presentation UI components.
